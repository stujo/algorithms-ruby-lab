#Intro to Algorithms Lab

A programmer interview

#Tweetlio 

You've seen a cool job posting for a software developer at Tweelio, the first thing they asked you to do was to complete an online programming test.

Good luck!

# Overall Setup and Submission Instructions

* Fork [https://github.com/wdi-sf-march-2014/algorithms-ruby-lab](https://github.com/wdi-sf-march-2014/algorithms-ruby-lab) to your GitHub account

* Clone __YOUR FORK__ to your laptop

* Read the Lab README.md (this file) 

* Once your work is complete, commit your changes locally

* Push your changes up to your fork on GitHub

* Make a Pull Request back to this Repository


# How to complete the Lab

* We want you to complete some Algorithms for us

* We have written some RSpec tests and provided you with a little bit of code

* All you need to do is make the tests pass, you may not change the tests

* You are complete when rspec runs without errors in the lab folder

* __ALL__ Your work will be done under the `lab/lib` folder

* `cd lab` and run `rspec` to see which tests are broken

* Make you changes (or add files if required) in the `lab/lib` folder that you see fit to get the tests to pass

* __Do Not__ change the tests (specs), if a test is failing make changes to your code to make it pass!

* If you get stuck, discuss the problem with your programming buddy, then ask an instructor

* Once you complete the lab or do not which to proceed further. Commit your changes to your local git repository and follow the instructions in __Overall Setup and Submission Instructions__  

* With some labs a solution may be provided for your reference in the `solution` folder. But __please do not refer to this__ until you have exhausted all other means of solving the lab. On some assignments the instructor may choose not to provide the solution until after the labwork has been submitted

#IMPORTANT NOTES!

* The specs for you code are in `shared/spec/lab_spec.rb` instead of the normal `spec` folder because the lab shares the tests between the solution and lab projects.

* Don't change the tests!

* It is not expected that you are able to complete the entire lab at this time, some people are more advanced at programming than others, so don't stress out. The process of trying to solve the problems _is_ the excercise and learning experience
